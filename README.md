# simVisSkeleton

## Components

There are three main files for this repo. The standard server.R and ui.R pair for Shiny applications and a helpers file collecting all the helper functions used in the server file.

## Purpose

This is a small demo for creating and visualizing forward curves using the underlying process of geometric brownian motion. It needs to plug into upstream databases which will feed the inputs needed for the simulations. 

The UI part demonstrates various selectors provided by the Shiny interface that give interactivity to the user who will determine some parameter values in the process.
